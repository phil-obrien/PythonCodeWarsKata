# PythonCodeWarsKata
Python - Completed Coding Puzzles on Codewars

The files in this repository are prefixed with kata_-N-kyu

The -N- designates a level of difficulty as presented on the codewars website. I've found some of the lower ranked kata
to be just as complex to solve as the higher ones (train of dominoes is a good example - never a level 5!).

Ranking goes from 1 to 8, where 1 is the hardest and 8 is the easiest (codewars ranking system).

All coding solutions are accompanied by a PDF detailing the problem (Requirements).
